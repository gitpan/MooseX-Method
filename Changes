0.42 2008-06-27
    - Add export methods back to Named and Positional
0.41 2008-05-29
    - Fix borked test coverage due to accidental include of methods, no
      real change.
0.40 2008-05-29
    - Preliminary support for compiled signatures that
      will in many cases yield a *significant* performance
      improvement. See the documentation for more
      information.
    - Requirements for various prerequisites lowered. Thanks
      to Max Kanat-Alexander for testing.

    * MooseX::Method
      - Declaring methods without coderefs inside roles
        will now make this role require a fully declared
        method in the class the role is merged into.
        When stevan gets around to adding the proper hooks,
        it will also be possible to specify required
        signatures.
      - You can now do 'no MooseX::Method' to unimport the
        symbols imported by MooseX::Method.

    * MooseX::Meta::(Parameter|Signature)
      - These are now roles, but think of them like abstract
        classes. They specify the API for implementing
        parameters and signatures. The old parameter class
        has been renamed to...

    * MooseX::Meta::Parameter::Moose
      - The old MooseX::Meta::Parameter.

    * MooseX::Meta::(Parameter|Signature)::Compiled
      - Roles for the compiling API.

    - Pass package and method names to wrap(), per changes to Class::MOP (gphat)

    - And probably lotsa other stuff.

0.39 Wed. August 1, 2007
    * MooseX::Meta::Parameter
      - Moved some checks from runtime to compiletime,
        which means performance improvements.
      - Support for union types (See Moose docs)
      - Support for specifying classnames as types.

    * MooseX::Meta::Method::Signature
      - Added methods for reading the signature.

    * MooseX::Method::Exception
      - New class for improved exception handling. The
        new exception handling is currently only used
        internally and will not affect users.

0.37 Wed. July 18, 2007
    * MooseX::Meta::Parameter
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Named
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Positional
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Combined
      - Added a method to export the internal data.

    * MooseX::Method
      - Made it easier to set default attributes with
        a default_attr function. It's basically just sugar
        for the old way so the old way will still work just
        fine.

0.36 Wed. July 18, 2007
    - More documentation.
    - Also, fixed documentation so a certain person's
      installation won't throw errors.

0.35 Tue. July 17, 2007
    * MooseX::Method
      - Removed noconfess in favour of simply using croak
        which gives you pretty much the same effect.
        Huzzahs to mst.

0.34 Tue. July 17, 2007
    - New internal error handling scheme, error messages
      will look slightly different.

    * MooseX::Method
      - You may now specify the "noconfess" attribute to
        remove the backtrace on validation error.

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Semi
      - Now known as...

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Combined
      - Which doesn't cause as much noise in my head.
        The keyword "semi" will continue to work for now,
        but will probably be removed sometime after
        version 1.0. More than likely, I'll add some noisy
        warnings to it at 1.0.

0.32 Thu. July 12, 2007
    - Shiny new test suite!

    * MooseX::Method
      - Actually mention in the documentation that
        signatures now are optional.
      - Moose does no longer need to be explicitly used,
        although it's still used as before under the
        hood.

0.31 Fri. July 9, 2007
    * MooseX::Method
      - Will now initialize a metaclass if none
        is found instead of throwing an error.
      - Signatures are now optional.

0.30 Fri. July 6, 2007
    - Improved documentation.

0.29 Thu. July 5, 2007
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature
      - This is no longer a role. It just feels better
        that signatures isa ::Signature.
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Semi
      - Combined positional and named syntax.

0.22 Tue. May 1, 2007
    !! NEW SYNTAX !!

    * MooseX::Method
      - New syntax.

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature
      - This is now a role.

0.20 Tue. May 1, 2007
    - Documentation stuff.

    * MooseX::Method
      - Add support for attributes.
      - Remove _dispatch_wrapper support, no longer
        neccesary.

0.18 Tue. May 1, 2007
    * MooseX::Method
      - Document a problem with roles.
      - Make Devel::Cover and MooseX::Method play
        nice together. :-)

0.17 Mon. April 30, 2007
    - 100% test coverage again.
    - Rethink the way names are specified to errors.
    - Fix various bugs.

0.16 Mon. April 30, 2007
    - Changed to Module::Install.
    - Documentation updates.

    * MooseX::Method
      - Let user supply a signature object.
      - Support a _dispatch_wrapper method that
        gets called if present in place of the
        actual method called.

    * MooseX::Meta::Parameter
      - Add support for roles.
      - Report parameter name/position in error
        messages.

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::(Named|Positional)
      - Supply name to parameter object.
