    - New internal error handling scheme, error messages
      will look slightly different.

    * MooseX::Method
      - You may now specify the "noconfess" attribute to
        remove the backtrace on validation error.

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Semi
      - Now known as...

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Combined
      - Which doesn't cause as much noise in my head.
        The keyword "semi" will continue to work for now,
        but will probably be removed sometime after
        version 1.0. More than likely, I'll add some noisy
        warnings to it at 1.0.

0.32 Thu. July 12, 2007
    - Shiny new test suite!

    * MooseX::Method
      - Actually mention in the documentation that
        signatures now are optional.
      - Moose does no longer need to be explicitly used,
        although it's still used as before under the
        hood.

0.31 Fri. July 9, 2007
    * MooseX::Method
      - Will now initialize a metaclass if none
        is found instead of throwing an error.
      - Signatures are now optional.

0.30 Fri. July 6, 2007
    - Improved documentation.

0.29 Thu. July 5, 2007
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature
      - This is no longer a role. It just feels better
        that signatures isa ::Signature.
    * MooseX::Meta::Signature::Semi
      - Combined positional and named syntax.

0.22 Tue. May 1, 2007
    !! NEW SYNTAX !!

    * MooseX::Method
      - New syntax.

    * MooseX::Meta::Signature
      - This is now a role.

0.20 Tue. May 1, 2007
    - Documentation stuff.

    * MooseX::Method
      - Add support for attributes.
      - Remove _dispatch_wrapper support, no longer
        neccesary.

      - Make Devel::Cover and MooseX::Method play
        nice together. :-)

    - 100% test coverage again.

    - Fix various bugs.

0.16 Mon. April 30, 2007
    - Changed to Module::Install.
    - Documentation updates.

    * MooseX::Method

      - Support a _dispatch_wrapper method that
        gets called if present in place of the
        actual method called.

    * MooseX::Meta::Parameter
      - Add support for roles.

        messages.
